\section{Introduction}
%Project purposes and goals go here
\subsection{Project Purpose}
Robotic testing, more specifically robot data collection, has been an area that, while well-documented, isn't well optimized. The time and amount of commands needed in order to set up a ROS environment to record test data is quite a lot. For example, to set up an environment to record tests with Project Chiron, around 10+ commands must be inputted in several different windows. The purpose of this project is to create an interface that is able to make the whole process of collecting data using ROS easier, from setup to data collection to data playback and storage.
\subsection{Project Goals}
The goals of this project are to simplify all the ROS connection commands and data collection setup into one simple interface. Doing so allows the entire process to be streamlined and eliminates the need to remember the list of complex commands needed to start recording manually. If the complexity is able to be taken out of the data recording process, then that means an expert in ROS will no longer have to be a requirement in order to set up and record a test. If the goal of creating a simplified interface can be met, then the interface can be applied to more than just the project here. It has the potential to be released as open-source software to be used with any robot that runs ROS.
\section{Project Status}
INSERT STATUS HERE - Mention struggle with networking/connection but don't go in depth, focus on almost to bare bones/alpha for specific use case to start expanding to general use case. Mention testing switch to Node

\section{Project Problems}
INSERT PROJECT PROBLEMS HERE - Go in depth on connection issues, good time to talk about having to dig into how python handles ssh, environment variables and how even bash scripts struggle.Perhaps include some code we've used to try and address.

\section{Interface Mockups}
INSERT BOTH MOCK-UPS AND GENERAL EXPLANATION OF UI RESEARCH DONE HERE - Detail both UI concerns but also code concerns.
