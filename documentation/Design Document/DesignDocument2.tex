This document serves to provide the overall design of the entire project. It includes the communication between the wheelchair computer and the personal computer, the methods used to store and present the data, and the interface that brings the entire process together. All of the technologies talked about in this document are the technologies that were chosen by our team to use with our project because they were determined to be the most advantageous to the goals of our project. This document does not contain the alternative technologies that our team looked at and researched, but ultimately did not choose.

\section{Introduction}
This document provides a high-level view of the robot test interface project, broken up into four conceptual layers. Marie Bomber has designed the project management layer, as well as the storage layer. Aaron Leondar has developed a design for the communication layer. Lastly, Hadi Rahal-Arabi has created a design for the user interface. These four layers have been designed to meet specifications provided by Matthew Shuman.

\subsection{Glossary}
\begin{description}
	\item [Bag] \hfill \break File format used in ROS for storing ROS message data
	\item [POMDP] \hfill \break Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. Per POMDP.org "This is a mathematical model that can capture the domain dynamics that include uncertainty in action effects and uncertainty in perceptual stimuli. Once a problem is captured as POMDP, it them becomes more amendable for solution using optimization techniques."  \cite{POMDP}
	\item Project Chiron \hfill \break A research project from Oregon State University's Personal Robotics Group focused on increasing the mobility of people with extreme disabilities\cite{Chiron}. 
	\item [Raspberry Pi] \hfill \break A credit card sized single-board computer. Project Chiron uses the Raspberry Pi to manage the wheelchair sensors and ROS installed.
	\item [Research Participant] \hfill \break Individual who has no access to the Robot Test collection interface, but will have a name and/or ID entry within the interface. Their role is to participate in one or more test sessions with Project Chiron.
	\item [Researcher] \hfill \break Admin level user of the Robot Test Collection interface. The researcher is expected to have full access to all user testing data (including names)
	\item [ROS] \hfill \break Robot Operating System

\section{Organization and Project Management}
\subsection{Overview}
Because the project includes three distinct design layers that will need to interact with complex ways, we have decided to include a project manager role to manage scheduling and delegation of tasks. This section will focus on the technologies to aid in project management as well as outlining responsibilities of the project manager's role. 
\subsection{Design Concerns}
When defining and delegating tasks, any tools used must allow for both high level and detailed explanation of the task. Integration between tools is also required, to help track project flow and proactively identify design issues. The project manager will need to be able to break down requirements into reasonable chunks and prioritize tasks with respect to application dependencies. The team is using an agile approach and therefore will need a project 'scrum' board, a version control system and a communication channel. 
\subsection{Design Elements}
To manage delegation of tasks, we have selected the waffle.io as our scrum board. It will allow the program manager to quickly create and delegate tasks, as well as add issue notes to either add user stories (to define a component in the system) or clarify the requirements of the task. Waffle.io was chosen because it integrates smoothly with public github repos so as components are added, their code can be stored on a separate branch and the task will be automatically moved to complete once the code is merged. Similarly, slack has been selected as the primary project communication channel, it integrates with waffle.io so updates are posted as tasks are moved, and files can easily be uploaded to store client meeting notes or share project information that does not easily store in git (such as PDFs). The project manager will be responsible for creating and delegating project tasks, whether they be related to development or classroom assignments. In addition, they will be responsible for ensuring the initial version of the application is available to the client in February so he can begin the first phase of testing. 

\section{Communication Layer}

\subsection{Overview}
The Communication Layer represents the interaction between the controllable wheelchair and the computer that the researcher is handling.  ROS, other than being used to communicate between the wheelchair and the local computer, also will be used to gather data when the wheelchair is run. The data collected will be stored in files called bags. These bags will contain the time from start to finish that the wheelchair was run, as well as any relevant sensor data. After the wheelchair is run and the bag collected, it is then transferred from the raspberry pi to the local computer, and stored on the computer.

\subsection{Design Concerns}
The bags must contains only relevant topics. While these topics are selected by the primary researcher, specific topic feeds can be quite large. The interface must be able to communicate to the researcher the estimated bag size, in order for the researcher to make an informed decision what information to include in their research. In addition, if a robot is expected to move during the course of a test, the connection between a robot and the testing interface may suffer, therefore, the system must be able to check and recover from a lost connection.

\subsection{Design Elements}
The wheelchair contains a raspberry pi computer that has ROS installed on it, as well as a wireless router that allows a local computer with Wi-Fi capabilities to connect to it. The local computer will be any computer that can run Linux, as Linux is required to run ROS on the wheelchair, and is Wi-Fi enabled to be able to communicate with the wheelchair. The computer will have to start out connected to the internet in order to connect to the robot. The computer will also need to stay connected while the robot performs its trial. Then once the trial ends, the bag with all the data collected from the trial will be stored on the robot.

\section{Storage Layer}
\subsection{Overview}
Once the ROSbag is received and processed by the system, it needs to be stored. This test information and the associated metadata, such as research participants name, time and date of trial and test instance, must be kept in such a way that the tester cannot retrieve the information, but the researcher can. This section will focus on the design concerns and decisions related to ROSbag storage. 
\subsection{Design Concerns}
The storage layer must be able to keep all test participant information secure. The researcher (and therefore, the application) has two competing needs in this regard. First, they need the test participants name as part of the initial research, this allows them to assess the test participants competency using the robotic wheelchair. Second, once the research is complete, this link between the test participant and the test data must be able to be severed completely once the initial stage of the research is complete. In addition, the researcher will not be the individual initiating and running the participant tests, so the ROSbag information must be stored securely so the tester cannot view the test information once the test is complete, but this must not interfere with the researchers access. 
\subsection{Design Elements}
To meet these competing design goals, as well as the inability to rely on an internet connection during the course of robotics tests, we have selected an on-board file system to store user tests. Upon test creation, the researcher will provide a list of participant names, or simply define how many participants will be included in the research. The interface will then create a directory for the test, as well as subdirectory for each participant. This will allow relevant test data to be stored for each participant. To preserve anonymity the names of participants are hashed, preventing participants from be linked to their test data, except via the interface. At such a time that the research wishes to delete the link permanently, the information used to create the hash can be removed and users will lose the ability to associate names with individual tests.
\section{UI Layer}
\subsection{Overview}
The UI layer handles user input, and passes it to the communication layer to begin recording bags. All user stories referenced in the requirements document begin with the user interacting with the UI layer of the application.

\subsection{Design Concerns}
The most critical factor in the success of the user interface is simplicity. The tester that interacts with the interface will have little computer science experience, and will not be expected to handle complex prompts and troubleshooting. Furthermore, the students maintaining the code for the user interface will be electrical engineers, and their only programming language experience will be python. This is the primary reason for writing the UI using python libraries, even though alternatives might prove simpler for initial development.

\subsection{Design Elements}
 In previous documents, the possibility of using nodejs and bootstrap to create a responsive web-interface for this application has been discussed. The combination of those two tools would provide a clean aesthetic and the easy possibility of extending the UI with an application programming interface. However, these tools are not ideal for the above design concerns: instead we will be implementing a system that is entirely written in python, using the web library Pyjamas for the user interface. 
 \\
 The graphical design of the interface has been given very specific design requirements by the client. The page should credit Matthew Shuman and the Oregon State Personal Robotics Group. The interface will contain a photo of the Permobile M300 wheelchair. On start, the page should display a large green "start session" button. When the button is pressed, it should be replaced with a red "end session" button. The colors on the page should conform to the Oregon State brand visual identity.
  
\section{Conclusion}
This document has summarized the data collection team's design decisions for the four layers of this project: the project management layer, the communication layer, the storage layer, and the UI layer. While there is some overlap in priorities, each layer has different design concerns and elements. The project management layer is utilizing organizational tools such as waffle.io and slack. The communication layer is comprised of ROS on top of Linux, to maximize compatibility with other projects in the Personal Robotics Group. The storage layer will be handled by a tree directory structure. The UI layer will be written in Python, to provide maintainability and readability to long-term users and developers in the Personal Robotics Group. When combined, the technologies in our four conceptual layers will provide the client with an application that meets all of the previously discussed requirements.
